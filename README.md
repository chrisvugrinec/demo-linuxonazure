# demo-linuxonazure
This contains the sourcecode and the presentation of linux solutions on Azure.
The sourcecode contains the following:
* create an immutable image with packer
* create a custom Linux VM that uses the Immutable image
* configure the custom Linux VM using ansible, in this demo I use the ansible code I used before for my ethereum demo
* code for creating a kubernetes cluster
* an example of a java app that can be deployed on the cluster

In the presentation I use VSTS to orchestrate the builds
